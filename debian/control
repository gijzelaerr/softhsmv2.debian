Description: Software implementation for Hardware Security Modules
 OpenDNSSEC handles and stores its cryptographic keys via the PKCS#11 interface.
 This interface specifies how to communicate with cryptographic devices such as
 HSM:s (Hardware Security Modules) and smart cards. The purpose of these devices
 is, among others, to generate cryptographic keys and sign information without
 revealing private-key material to the outside world. They are often designed to
 perform well on these specific tasks compared to ordinary processes in a normal
 computer.
 .
 A potential problem with the use of the PKCS#11 interface is that it might
 limit the wide spread use of OpenDNSSEC, since a potential user might not be
 willing to invest in a new hardware device. To counter this effect, OpenDNSSEC
 is providing a software implementation of a generic cryptographic device with a
 PKCS#11 interface, the SoftHSM. SoftHSM is designed to meet the requirements of
 OpenDNSSEC, but can also work together with other cryptographic products
 because of the PKCS#11 interface.
